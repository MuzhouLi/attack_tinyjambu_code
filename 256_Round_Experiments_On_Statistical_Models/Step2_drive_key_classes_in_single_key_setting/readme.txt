This code is used to drive key classes and list corresponding keys in the key class.

Notice that list "involved_KeyBits" and "TrailNum_Parts" should be modified according to "ForArrayIn_Step2.txt" and "LinearTrails_RepeatedSolutionsRemoved.txt", respectively. A file named "ForArrayIn_Step3.txt" is created, which will be used in Step 3.

Usage: 

python3 -u Step2_drive_key_classes.py
